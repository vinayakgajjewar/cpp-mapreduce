MapReduce is a programming model and software framework that is used to process large amounts of data in parallel across a large number of distributed servers. It was created by Google in 2004 and is now widely used in industry and academia for handling big data.

The MapReduce model is composed of two main functions: the map function and the reduce function. The map function is responsible for taking input data and processing it into key-value pairs, while the reduce function takes those key-value pairs and performs a computation on them to produce a final output.
